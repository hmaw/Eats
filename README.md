# Eats #
### Custom Eats: a small program that lets you remeber what you have tried to eat when you were at a resturant in the past. This is in order to be able to recall what you had, and if any modifcations to the order is needed to bring up your pleasure levels with the dish.

Often useful for those that are advoiding things like gluten, soy, mushrooms or the _dreaded_ bell peppers.   As we are just ordanary people and not doctors, we can't tell you what to advoid for allergies, but any little thing can help you remember when you had a bad meal and not repeat it half a year later when you don't remember it clearly anymore.
